        Declarative Schema aims to simplify the Magento installation and upgrade processes. The new declarative schema approach allows developers to declare the final desired state of the database and has the system adjust to it automatically, without performing redundant operations. Developers are no longer forced to write scripts for each new version. In addition, this approach allows data be deleted when a module is uninstalled.
